                    <!-- Comment: Link to Thinkful website within Content -->
                    <p>I have always had a thirst for knowledge and experience.  The questions “why and how does something work in that way” are not foreign to the inner processes of my mind.  My early adult life provided the opportunity to quench some of that thirst for knowledge and experience, as well as indulged my creative side, by allowing me to travel and live around the world while working as a performer in the entertainment industry.  I sought further knowledge about how businesses operated by eventually transitioning into management within the food and beverage industry. Throughout all this, something was lacking: passion.</p>
                    <p>It was when I began exploring software development that I finally felt that seemingly elusive concept called passion.  All the things that meant something to me seemed to fit right into place: here is a world where multiple languages communicate with each other - work with each other - to create a final beautiful product.  That’s powerful. And I love finding and creating beauty in the world around me. As such, I could not be more excited to begin my software development journey as a student with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>.</p>
                    <p>If you are looking to collaborate on a project, let’s connect!  I love creating digital content that can be used across the web and social media platforms, or tackling any new challenge that pushes the limits on my current understanding of development concepts.  Or if you simply need a break in your day and want to trade gym tips, swap healthy recipes, chat about the current Pokémon metagame, or talk amazing tunes, I’m here!  Let’s learn and grow from each other by working together.</p>
                    <p>If you are looking for help with branding, design, web app development, or any combination of the three, look no further.  I will work with you to create not only the product that you want, but also the product that is uniquely you.</p>
                    <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer who loves working with people, who thrives in an environment of continued learning and training, and who isn’t afraid to put in the work to build something beautiful, please reach out.  More importantly, if you are looking to hire someone who listens carefully and knows how to interpret the received information to deliver the client's desired results, don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>
                    <p>Let’s help others connect to their passions.</p>
